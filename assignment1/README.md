# I had trouble locating the tag of elements I wanted at first. However, with the help of TA, I changed xpath into css_selector and successfully crawling the number of reposts, comments and like.


#7.Future work
# For a thorough analysis, I am going to enrich my dataset by crawling microblogs which are searched with more keywords related to MeToo.
